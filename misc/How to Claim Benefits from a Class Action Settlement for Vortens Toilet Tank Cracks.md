# How to Claim Benefits from a Class Action Settlement for Vortens Toilet Tank Cracks
 
If you own or owned a Vortens brand toilet tank model #3464 or #3412 manufactured in 2011, you may be eligible for benefits from a class action settlement. The settlement resolves claims that these toilet tanks were defective and could crack spontaneously, causing water damage to your property.

The settlement covers the purchase and possession of an affected toilet tank, as well as payments made to reimburse property damage suffered as a result of the failure of an affected toilet tank. Depending on your situation, you may be entitled to:
 
- Reimbursement of up to $300 per replaced tank if you have proof of ownership and expenses.
- Reimbursement of $150 per replaced tank if you have proof of ownership but not expenses.
- Reimbursement of up to $300 per tank for replacement and installation costs if you still own an affected tank.
- Reimbursement of up to $4,000 for unreimbursed out-of-pocket expenses incurred due to property damage caused by a cracked tank if you have proof of ownership and expenses.
- Reimbursement of up to $150 for property damage expenses if you have proof of ownership but not expenses.

To claim these benefits, you need to submit a claim form online or by mail by October 15, 2019. You also need to provide documentary proof of ownership, such as photographs showing the manufacturing date stamp and the four-digit model number stamp inside the tank and/or barcode label, home purchase documents, installer records, builder records, and/or deed information. You also need to provide documentary proof of expenses, such as receipts, invoices, insurance claim records, and/or banking/credit purchase or expenditure documentation.
 
If you do not have these documents, you may submit a sworn declaration of replacement and/or property damage and expense details. However, your reimbursement amount may be reduced.
 
If you reside within 100 miles of a designated distribution center, you may also choose to participate in the replacement and installation program, which allows Vortens to provide replacement product and installation services without upfront costs.
 
If you want to exclude yourself from the settlement or object to its terms, you need to do so by July 1, 2019 or July 15, 2019 respectively. For more information about the settlement and your rights and options, please visit **[^1^]** or call **1-888-266-0275**.
  
The class action settlement was reached with Porcelana Corona de Mexico, S.A. de C.V. f/k/a/ Sanitarios Lamosa S.A. de C.V. a/k/a Vortens, the manufacturer of the affected toilet tanks. The company denies any wrongdoing or liability, but agreed to the settlement to avoid further litigation.
 
The settlement was approved by the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Texas on August 15, 2019. The court found that the settlement was fair, reasonable, and adequate for the class members.
 
If you are a class member and do not submit a claim form by the deadline, you will not receive any benefits from the settlement and you will give up your right to sue Vortens or any other released parties for any claims related to the defective toilet tanks.
