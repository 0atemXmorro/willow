## How to Read Tabel Baja
 
Tabel Baja consists of several tables that show different types of steel, such as WF (Wide Flange), CNP (Channel), H-Beam (Hot Rolled Beam), Profil (Profile), and others. Each table has columns that indicate the name, symbol, dimension, area, weight per meter, weight per 12 meters, and modulus of section of each type of steel. For example, in the table for WF steel, you can see that WF 150 x 75 x 5 x 7 has a dimension of 150 mm x 75 mm x 5 mm x 7 mm, an area of 14 cm, a weight per meter of 14 kg, a weight per 12 meters of 168 kg, and a modulus of section of 349 cm.
 
To read Tabel Baja, you need to know the type of steel that you need for your project. Then, you can look for the table that corresponds to that type of steel. Next, you can compare the dimensions and weights of different types of steel within that table and choose the one that suits your requirements. You can also use the modulus of section to calculate the strength or stiffness of the steel.
