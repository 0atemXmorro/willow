# What is PSIM 9.2 and why you should use it for power electronics simulation
 
PSIM 9.2 is a simulation tool designed for power electronics and motor control. It is developed by Powersim, Inc., a leading provider of software solutions for power electronics design and analysis. PSIM 9.2 offers fast and accurate simulation of various power converters, motors, drives, and control systems. It also supports subcircuit function, which allows part of a circuit to be represented by a subcircuit block, and C block, which allows users to write custom C code for simulation.

PSIM 9.2 has many advantages over other simulation tools in the market. Some of them are:
 
- It has a user-friendly interface that allows users to easily create and modify circuits using drag-and-drop and copy-and-paste functions.
- It has a large library of built-in elements, including switches, diodes, transistors, transformers, inductors, capacitors, resistors, sources, loads, sensors, controllers, and more.
- It has a powerful solver that can handle stiff systems and nonlinearities with ease. It can also simulate circuits with multiple time scales and switching frequencies.
- It has a waveform display program Simview that can plot various signals and parameters in real time or offline. Simview can also perform post-processing functions such as FFT, RMS, THD, etc.
- It has several modules that extend its capabilities for specific applications, such as motor drive module, digital control module, thermal module, magnetic module, etc.
- It has a SmartCtrl demo that can help users design and optimize feedback controllers for power converters.

If you are interested in learning more about PSIM 9.2 or trying it out yourself, you can download a free demo version from the Powersim website[^2^]. The demo version is limited to 34 elements in circuit size and some functions are disabled. You can also request a 15-day trial of PSIM with advanced capabilities from the same website[^2^]. PSIM is compatible with Windows XP/Vista/7/8/10 operating systems.
 
PSIM 9.2 is a powerful and versatile simulation tool that can help you design and analyze power electronics systems faster and better. Whether you are a student, researcher, or engineer working in the field of power electronics, you will find PSIM 9.2 to be a valuable tool for your projects.
  
## How to get started with PSIM 9.2
 
If you are new to PSIM 9.2, you may want to watch this video tutorial[^3^] that shows you how to place and connect elements, run simulations, and view waveforms. You can also access the PSIM help file from the menu bar or by pressing F1. The help file contains detailed information on how to use PSIM 9.2, as well as examples, tutorials, and video links for various topics.
 
One of the features of PSIM 9.2 that you may find useful is the parameter file function. This function allows you to store and load circuit parameters in a text file, which can be edited externally or by using a script. This way, you can easily change circuit parameters without modifying the schematic. You can watch this video tutorial[^1^] to learn how to use parameter files in PSIM 9.2.
  
## How to use modules in PSIM 9.2
 
PSIM 9.2 has several modules that extend its capabilities for specific applications. For example, if you are working on motor control systems, you may want to use the Motor Drive Module, which provides models of various motors and drives, such as induction motor, permanent magnet synchronous motor (PMSM), brushless DC motor (BLDC), etc. You can also use the JMAG-RT Module, which allows you to import JMAG-RT models of motors and generators into PSIM 9.2 for simulation.
 
If you are working on digital control systems, you may want to use the Digital Control Module, which provides functions for digital controller design and implementation. You can also use the Auto Code Generation function, which can generate C code for TI DSPs or Arduino boards from PSIM 9.2 schematic. You can watch this video tutorial[^1^] to learn how to use auto code generation for F2833X DSP.
 
If you are working on power converter analysis, you may want to use the AC Sweep function, which can perform frequency-domain analysis of power converters with or without digital delay. You can also use the SmartCtrl function, which can help you design and optimize feedback controllers for power converters. You can watch this video tutorial[^1^] to learn how to use SmartCtrl to design outer voltage loop of a buck converter.
